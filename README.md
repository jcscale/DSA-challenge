This is a record of my study into data structures and algorithms.

# Problem 1: Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
